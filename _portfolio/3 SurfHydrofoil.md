When hydrofoils were first entering the surf scene of Southern California, the effortless glide of surfing frictionless, 12 inches above the water piqued my interest. However, the $2k price tag for the entire setup (foil, mast, and board) was prohibitive to my budget for surf craft. I took this as an opportunity to see if I could make one myself.

By modeling the main wing in XFLR5, I was able to engineer a foil that would account for my weight, the density of saltwater, and the speed of an average ocean wave. I shaped the wings using bent plywood and reinforced them with multiple layers of fiberglass. The fuselage and mast were also constructed with plywood and were reinforced with layers of uni-directional carbon fiber.
