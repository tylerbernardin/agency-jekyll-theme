This is a project I worked on during my time at Capsule Manufacturing. As the lead engineer for this build, I took it from conception through delivery. The idea was to create a fully functional espresso bar that could be easily moved from place to place on the LinkedIn campus. This bar consisted of four modules that could be easily connected or disconnected for transportation.

The bar was constructed out of premium powder-coated aluminum and stainless steel. Equipped with onboard water and all the essentials of a normal espresso bar, coffee could be served all day wherever it was needed.
